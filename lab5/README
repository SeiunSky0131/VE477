This lab implement two algorithms:
1.Dijkstra (using Fibonacci Heap written in lab4)
2.Bellman-Ford (with relax judge, which means when there is no update when a round ends, stop to improve efficiency)
Also, two data structures: SparseGraph and DenseGraph are implemented to support methods include:
1.AddVertex
2.RemoveVertex
3.AddEdge
4.RemoveEdge
5.IsAdjacent
The SpareGraph should be based on Adjacency list and the DenseGraph should be based on Adjacency matrix.
